# Flat Path System

## Prompt
Now the last update I want in the base form is that all child objects is under one property of so that properties don't accidently get overwritten. So I was thinking of adding a property called
children or nodes or just simply _

But then I though that what if $ could be accessed in this way:
const objValue = `$('path.to.some.dyn.obj')  // First the normal way`
const objvalue = `$('obj').branch('path.to.some.dyn')`;
So now it would use the branch method to set the root, but not as an `object` but as a string like a shortcut so it  would look like this: $['path.to.some.dyn']
So they key is `'path.to.some.dyn'`

So when the `proxy` adds a `child` `object` to an `object` then it is not adding it directly to the `object` itself but to the root `$['path.to.some.dyn']['obj'].value = value;  // Here I am showing what the proxy would do not the user`. 

The user would never use it this way, for the user there are just this way `$(path)` or `$.path` way and the proxy creates the the path keys as strings, so for the dev's it feels like they are accessing nested `objects` but they are in fact not.
This way each `object` never really has any children but the is a key that represents that `object` with `dynamic` `objects` on them and no `object` will ever be more than 2 levels deep to find, and when `objects` are accessed the path can be use literally when used like `#('path.to.some.dyn')` or the toString can maybe be used to get the key names when used like `$.path.to.some.dyn.obj;`

Do you understand what I mean this would make the system a lot scalable with none of the overhead 

### Response

Yes, I understand what you're proposing. The system you're describing separates **user-perceived nested objects** from their **actual underlying structure** to achieve better scalability and eliminate potential overhead.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Flat Storage Using Paths as Keys**  
   - Instead of nesting objects within objects, all dynamic objects are stored flatly at the root `Systemic` instance using their **full paths as keys** (e.g., `'path.to.some.dyn.obj'`).

2. **Access via Proxies**  
   - Users still perceive the system as hierarchical because the proxy intercepts `get` and `set` operations and transparently resolves them using the flat storage.

3. **Shortcut Methods (`branch` and `$[key]`)**  
   - Users can directly access or manipulate objects using the `branch` method or by treating `$[key]` as an object with dynamic paths as keys.

4. **Dynamic Object Representation**  
   - A dynamic object is always represented as an independent entity with no direct children.  
   - Child objects are stored in the flat structure, referenced by their paths.

5. **No Nested Objects in Reality**  
   - In practice, no dynamic object contains children; all child objects are **resolved on-demand** from the flat storage.

---

### **How This Works**

#### **Flat Storage**

All dynamic objects are stored in the root `Systemic` instance as:
```javascript
$['path.to.some.dyn.obj'] = dynamicObject;
```

---

#### **Proxies**

Proxies intercept access and use the path to:
- Retrieve the object from flat storage.
- Create new objects if they don't exist.

---

#### **User Access Patterns**

Users can access objects in one of two ways:
1. **Traditional Path Resolution:**  
   ```javascript
   const obj = $('path.to.some.dyn.obj');
   obj.val('New Value');
   ```

2. **Branch-Based Access:**  
   ```javascript
   const branch = $('path.to.some').branch('dyn.obj');
   branch.val('New Value');
   ```

---

#### **Implementation Details**

1. **Dynamic Path Keys:**  
   Every dynamic object is assigned a unique key based on its path:
   ```javascript
   $['path.to.some.dyn.obj'];
   ```

2. **Proxy Behavior:**  
   When accessing properties, the proxy automatically:
   - Constructs the full path.
   - Resolves the dynamic object from flat storage.

3. **Branching:**  
   The `branch` method allows creating shortcuts for deeper paths:
   ```javascript
   const branch = $('path.to.some').branch('dyn.obj');
   ```

---

### **Advantages**

1. **Scalability:**  
   - No deeply nested objects; every dynamic object is at most two levels deep in the flat structure.

2. **Simplicity:**  
   - The flat structure eliminates complex traversal logic.

3. **Consistency:**  
   - Users always perceive the system as hierarchical, but the implementation avoids the overhead of actual nesting.

### **Updated Base Functionality**

Hereâ€™s how the **base `Systemic` class** would work with this system:

```javascript
class Systemic {
  constructor() {
    this.storage = {}; // Flat storage for all dynamic objects
  }

  /**
   * Create or resolve a dynamic object at a given path.
   * @param {string} path - The path to the dynamic object.
   * @returns {Proxy} - The proxy-wrapped dynamic object.
   */
  resolvePath(path) {
    if (!this.storage[path]) {
      this.storage[path] = this.createDynamicObject({ path });
    }
    return this.storage[path].proxy;
  }

  /**
   * Add branching support for dynamic paths.
   * @param {string} path - The base path.
   * @returns {Object} - A branch object for further path resolution.
   */
  branch(path) {
    const basePath = this.path;
    return {
      resolve: (subPath) => this.resolvePath(`${basePath}.${subPath}`),
    };
  }

  /**
   * Create a new dynamic object with base functionality.
   * @param {Object} params - Initial parameters for the dynamic object.
   * @returns {Object} - The dynamic object.
   */
  createDynamicObject(params = {}) {
    const core = {
      value: null,
      type: 'Static',
      proxy: null,
      path: params.path,
    };

    return this.wrapWithProxy(core);
  }

  /**
   * Wrap a dynamic object with a proxy for property interception.
   * @param {Object} object - The dynamic object.
   * @returns {Proxy} - The proxy-wrapped dynamic object.
   */
  wrapWithProxy(object) {
    const proxy = new Proxy(object, {
      get: (target, prop) => {
        if (prop === 'proxy') return proxy;
        if (prop === 'value') return target.value;
        if (prop === 'path') return target.path;

        const fullPath = `${target.path}.${prop}`;
        return this.resolvePath(fullPath); // Resolve child object by path
      },
      set: (target, prop, value) => {
        const fullPath = `${target.path}.${prop}`;
        const child = this.resolvePath(fullPath);
        child.value = value; // Set value on child object
        return true;
      },
    });

    object.proxy = proxy;
    return proxy;
  }

  /**
   * Get or set the value of a dynamic object.
   * @param {string} path - The path to the dynamic object.
   * @param {any} [value] - The value to set (if provided).
   * @returns {any} - The value of the dynamic object.
   */
  val(path, value) {
    const obj = this.resolvePath(path);
    if (value !== undefined) {
      obj.value = value;
      return this;
    }
    return obj.value;
  }

  /**
   * Set properties on a dynamic object at a given path.
   * @param {string} path - The path to the dynamic object.
   * @param {Object} obj - The object literal to set.
   */
  set(path, obj) {
    const dynamicObject = this.resolvePath(path);
    if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && !Array.isArray(obj)) {
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
        dynamicObject[key] = value; // Add properties directly to the object
      }
    } else {
      dynamicObject.value = obj; // Fallback to setting the value
    }
  }
}

// Export singleton instance
const systemic = new Systemic();
export default systemic;
```

### **Next Steps**

Would you like me to:
1. Expand this with specific examples for how paths work with flat storage?
2. Add functionality for branching (`branch` method)?
3. Introduce plugins for additional behavior (e.g., `children`, `observe`, `DOM`)?  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
