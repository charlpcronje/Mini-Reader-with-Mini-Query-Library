### **Base Functionality of the Systemic Class (Without Plugins)**

1. **Dynamic Object Creation**  
   - Creates a dynamic object with minimal default properties: `value`, `proxy`, and `type`.

2. **Proxy Wrapping**  
   - Wraps dynamic objects in a proxy to intercept `get` and `set` operations.

3. **Path Resolution**  
   - Resolves paths (`$.resolvePath('path.to.object')`) to dynamically create or retrieve objects along the specified path.

4. **`set` Method (on Singleton Root)**  
   - Sets the properties of a dynamic object at a specified path based on the provided object literal.  
   - If the value is an object literal:
     - Properties of the literal are added directly to the dynamic object.  
   - If the value is an instance of a class or non-literal object:
     - The entire object is set to the `value` property of the dynamic object.

5. **`val` Method (on Singleton Root and Dynamic Objects)**  
   - On the root:
     - Gets or sets the `value` property of a dynamic object at a specified path.  
   - On a dynamic object:
     - Gets or sets the `value` property directly.

6. **Proxy Transparency for `value`**  
   - Accessing a dynamic object's property directly (`dynamicObject.property`) returns the `value` property transparently through the proxy.

7. **Minimal Core Structure**  
   - Dynamic objects contain only the basic properties (`value`, `type`, `proxy`) with no additional functionality or behaviors.
