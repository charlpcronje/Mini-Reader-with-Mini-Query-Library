## Initial Specification

### Comprehensive Specification: Granular System for Reactive, Decentralized Communication and State Management

This specification outlines a comprehensive system that evolves from a **single-browser application** into a **globally distributed, decentralized network**. The system is built in phases to ensure incremental implementation and functionality expansion.

---

## **Phase 1: Core Reactive Singleton (Single-Browser Application)**

### **Objective**
Create a reactive `Singleton` class where dynamic objects can observe each other, send observers to parents or siblings, and manage state efficiently. The system supports single-page applications with self-contained components.

### **Features**
1. **Dynamic Object Creation**:
   - Each dynamic object can have:
     - A `value` property (e.g., a computed or static value).
     - An `observe` property to manage observers.

2. **Reactive State Management**:
   - Objects can observe other objects and react to changes dynamically.
   - Observers can be propagated to parent or sibling objects.

3. **Hierarchical Notification**:
   - Parent objects automatically aggregate and observe the values and states of their children.
   - Changes in a child trigger updates in the parent hierarchy.

4. **Use in Single-Page Applications**:
   - Each page component dynamically loads and unloads its dynamic objects based on the application state.
   - Components self-update based on observed changes.

### **Use Cases**
- SPA dashboards aggregating data from multiple widgets.
- Real-time form validation where fields dynamically observe parent validation rules.
- Interactive UI elements that observe each other's states for cascading updates.

## **Phase 2: Multi-Instance Communication (Decentralized Network)**

### **Objective**
Extend the reactive system to work across multiple instances (e.g., browser tabs or devices), enabling **peer-to-peer communication** while minimizing reliance on a central server.

### **Features**
1. **Instance Registration**:
   - Each instance registers itself with a central server or discovery mechanism.
   - The server tracks active instances and their capabilities.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Communication**:
   - Instances communicate directly, sharing data or propagating state changes.
   - Instances dynamically discover and interact with their nearest neighbors.

3. **Leader-Based Coordination**:
   - A leader is elected for each group or cluster of instances.
   - The leader aggregates data and coordinates communication to reduce network traffic.

4. **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Instances maintain multiple redundant paths for communication.
   - If a path fails, an alternative route is selected dynamically.

5. **Data Fetching and Caching**:
   - Data is fetched from the most up-to-date instance rather than directly from the server.
   - Instances cache data and synchronize updates with peers.

6. **Cluster Formation**:
   - Instances are grouped into clusters based on logical or physical proximity (e.g., geolocation, latency).
   - Each cluster operates semi-independently, minimizing global communication.

### **Use Cases**
- Collaborative applications where multiple users interact with shared data.
- Real-time updates in multi-device setups (e.g., dashboards, IoT systems).

## **Phase 3: Decentralized Communication Network**

### **Objective**
Implement a **worldwide decentralized communication system** where nodes interact anonymously, enabling applications like secure messaging, anonymous file sharing, and resilient global communication.

### **Features**
1. **Limited Knowledge**:
   - Each node (instance) knows only its two nearest neighbors.
   - Communication paths are dynamically adjusted as nodes join or leave.

2. **Symmetric Data Flow**:
   - Data flows in a symmetric path:
     - Retrieved data follows the same path back to the database.
     - Each node along the way adds verification and redundancy.

3. **End-to-End Encryption**:
   - Messages are encrypted at the source and decrypted only at the destination.
   - Intermediate nodes forward encrypted messages without accessing their contents.

4. **Binary Tree-Style Broadcasting**:
   - Updates are propagated exponentially:
     - Each node sends updates to two neighbors, which then propagate to two more neighbors, and so on.
   - This ensures rapid dissemination of updates while minimizing load on any single node.

5. **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Data is sent through multiple redundant paths to ensure delivery.
   - Nodes dynamically re-route data if a neighbor becomes unresponsive.

6. **Use for Anonymous Applications**:
   - Nodes anonymize communication by limiting the visibility of the sender and receiver.
   - Messages can be verified and validated without exposing identities.

### **Use Cases**
- Anonymous chat applications with untraceable communication.
- Decentralized marketplaces with secure, private transactions.
- Global information-sharing platforms with built-in anonymity and resilience.

## **Phase 4: Advanced Functionality**

### **Objective**
Expand the system to include features for advanced use cases like real-time fault detection, distributed load balancing, and intelligent data aggregation.

### **Features**
1. **Dynamic Leader Election**:
   - Leaders are dynamically elected within clusters based on performance metrics (e.g., latency, uptime).
   - Leaders handle critical coordination tasks like batching updates or interacting with the central server.

2. **Geo-Partitioning**:
   - Nodes are grouped based on geographic proximity to reduce latency.
   - Each partition operates semi-independently, optimizing communication.

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Leaders distribute tasks among cluster members to prevent overload.
   - Tasks like data aggregation or broadcasting are balanced across multiple nodes.

4. **Error Detection and Recovery**:
   - Nodes verify the integrity of messages using cryptographic checksums.
   - Errors trigger retransmissions or alternative routing paths.

5. **Hybrid Models**:
   - Combine peer-to-peer communication with server-based coordination for highly dynamic systems.
   - Use servers as fallback mechanisms for critical tasks like data synchronization.

### **Use Cases**
- Large-scale systems with millions of nodes (e.g., IoT networks, global messaging platforms).
- High-availability applications requiring fault tolerance and real-time error recovery.
