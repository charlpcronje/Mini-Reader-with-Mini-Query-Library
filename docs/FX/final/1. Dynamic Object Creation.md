## **1. Dynamic Object Creation**

Dynamic object creation is the foundation of the Reactive Singleton system. It defines how objects are initialized, wrapped with proxies, and set up with their core properties. This base implementation ensures modularity, extensibility, and readiness for reactivity.

---

### **1. Initialization of Core Properties**
- **Objective:** Ensure every dynamic object is initialized with minimal default properties and supports extensibility through plugins.
- **Specification:**
  - **Default Properties:**
    - `value`: Default set to `null`, representing the primary data of the object.
    - `type`: Set to `Static` by default; can be configured during creation.
    - `proxy`: This points to the actual proxy after it is applied so that the proxy can be updated as needed dynamically. Initially set to `null`; the proxy is attached during wrapping.
    - `nodes`: A key-value pair object for storing all child objects.
  - **Lifecycle Hooks:**
    - `onCreate`: A lifecycle hook triggered after property initialization, allowing plugins to extend functionality.
    - `onReady`: A lifecycle hook triggered once all initialization and wrapping are complete.

---

### **2. Plugin System**
- **Objective:** Provide a modular architecture where plugins extend the functionality of dynamic objects during their creation.
- **Specification:**
  - **Plugin Interface:**
    - Each plugin must have a `name` and an `apply` method:
      - `name`: A unique identifier for the plugin.
      - `apply(core)`: A method that modifies the dynamic object during its creation.
  - **Plugin Registration:**
    - Plugins are registered globally on the singleton.
    - Plugins can either be applied to every dynamic object or to dynamic objects with a specific type during creation.
  - **Plugin Example:**
    ```javascript
    const examplePlugin = {
      name: "example",
      apply(core) {
        core.exampleProperty = "example";
      },
    };
    ```

### **3. Wrapping with a Proxy**
- **Objective:** Encapsulate dynamic objects with a proxy for property interception and runtime behavior management.
- **Specification:**
  - **Proxy Behaviors:**
    - **Getter (`get`) Trap:**
      - Dynamically initializes properties if they do not exist.
      - Resolves the `value` property transparently for immediate access.
    - **Setter (`set`) Trap:**
      - Updates properties or creates new dynamic objects as necessary.
      - Adds new dynamic objects to the `nodes` property as key-value pairs when created.
  - **Customization:**
    - Plugins can modify the behavior of proxy traps to suit specific use cases.

---

### **4. Path Resolution**
- **Objective:** Provide a mechanism to resolve paths dynamically, creating intermediate objects if necessary.
- **Specification:**
  - **Path Resolution Behavior:**
    - Resolves string paths like `$.resolvePath('path.to.object')` into dynamic objects.
    - Creates intermediate objects along the path if they do not already exist.
  - **Integration with Plugins:**
    - Plugins can extend or modify path resolution behavior.

---

### **5. `set` and `val` Methods**
- **Objective:** Provide distinct methods for setting and retrieving properties or values.
- **Specification:**
  - **`set` Method:**
    - Available only on the singleton root (`$.set(path, value)`).
    - **Behavior:**
      - If `value` is an object literal:
        - Its properties are added directly to the dynamic object at the specified path.
      - If `value` is an instance of a class or non-literal object:
        - The entire object is set to the `value` property of the dynamic object.
  - **`val` Method:**
    - Available on both the singleton root (`$.val(path, value, defaultValue)`) and dynamic objects `$('path').val(value)`.
    - **Behavior:**
      - **Singleton Root:**
        - Gets or sets the `value` property of the dynamic object at the specified path.
      - **Dynamic Object:**
        - Gets or sets the `value` property directly.

---

### **6. Automatic Registration**
- **Objective:** Automatically integrate the dynamic object into its hierarchy.
- **Specification:**
  - **Parent Integration:**
    - New child objects are automatically added to the parentâ€™s `nodes` property as key-value pairs.
  - **Nodes Property Behavior:**
    - A `nodes` property exists on every dynamic object:
      - Stores child objects in a key-value pair format.
      - Automatically updated when new properties are added to the dynamic object.

---

### **Lifecycle of Dynamic Object Creation**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Core properties (`value`, `type`, `proxy`, `nodes`) are initialized with default values.
   - Lifecycle hooks (`onCreate`) are prepared for execution.

2. **Plugin Application:**
   - All registered plugins are applied to the dynamic object during its creation and per type as set in the plugin's types property that is an array of types it must be added to, if a plugin's type property is set to a single single value of '*' then it means that it should apply to all types

3. **Proxy Wrapping:**
   - The object is wrapped with a proxy to manage runtime behaviors dynamically.

4. **Ready State:**
   - The `onReady` lifecycle hook is triggered, signaling the object is fully initialized.

---

### **Use Case Scenarios**

#### **1. Modular Property Management**
- **Scenario:**
  - A dynamic object has child objects added dynamically.
- **Behavior:**
  - All child objects are automatically stored in the `nodes` property as key-value pairs.

#### **2. Plugin-Based Customization**
- **Scenario:**
  - A plugin adds a `actions` property to dynamic objects.
- **Behavior:**
  - The `actions` property is added only if the plugin is registered.

#### **3. Flexible Value Management**
- **Scenario:**
  - `$.set()` is used to add properties to a dynamic object.
  - `$.val()` retrieves or updates the `value` property.
- **Behavior:**
  - The object structure reflects whether values were added directly or as properties.

### **Benefits**

1. **Modularity:**  
   Each dynamic object is lightweight and extensible via plugins.

2. **Flexibility:**  
   Core functionality like `set` and `val` provide a consistent interface for property management.

3. **Scalability:**  
   The `nodes` property simplifies hierarchical management of child objects.

4. **Extensibility:**  
   Plugins can customize every aspect of the dynamic object lifecycle.
