### **Dynamic Objects as a frontend
Workflowy is a lightweight, hierarchical note-taking and organizational tool. Its strength lies in infinite nesting, simplicity, and fast navigation through collapsible outlines. It supports personal productivity by enabling users to brainstorm, organize ideas, track tasks, and collaborate with others.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **1. User Interface**
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean, distraction-free interface with a white or dark background.
- **Infinite Nested Lists**: Each item in the list can have an unlimited number of sub-items, allowing users to create a deeply nested hierarchy.
- **Collapsible Items**: Users can expand or collapse any item to focus on specific sections of the list.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Displays the path to the current location in the hierarchy and allows quick traversal to parent items.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full keyboard navigation for creating, editing, moving, and navigating list items.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag items to reorder them or move them to different parent items.
- **Search Bar**: A global search feature to find items instantly, with a live filtering mechanism.
- **Tagging System**: Support for tags (e.g., `#tag`) and references (e.g., `@mention`) within items.
- **Zoom into Nodes**: The ability to zoom into a specific node and treat it as the root for focused work.

---

#### **2. Core Functionalities**
- **Dynamic Item Creation**: Create, edit, and delete list items instantly without leaving the current interface.
- **Inline Editing**: Edit text directly in the list without switching modes.
- **Task Management Features**:
  - Checkbox toggle to mark items as completed.
  - Automatically group completed items under a "Completed" section or style them differently.
- **Multi-Selection**: Select multiple items to move, delete, or copy them simultaneously.
- **Clipboard Support**:
  - Copy-paste items within the app or to external apps (e.g., as plain text, Markdown, or OPML).
  - Paste external text to create nested lists automatically.
- **Undo/Redo**: Unlimited undo and redo operations to reverse changes quickly.
- **Automatic Backups**: Regular automatic saving and versioning of changes.

---

#### **3. Collaboration Features**
- **Sharing**:
  - Share specific nodes or entire workspaces via a unique link.
  - Define access permissions (view-only, comment-only, or edit).
- **Real-Time Collaboration**:
  - Multiple users can edit the same workspace simultaneously, with changes appearing in real-time.
  - Visual indicators of who is editing a specific node.
- **Comments**: Add comments or notes to specific items for discussion.
- **Change History**: Track and view the edit history of each node.

---

#### **4. Data Management**
- **Data Format**: Store list data in a tree structure with each node containing:
  - Unique ID
  - Text content
  - Parent ID (for hierarchy)
  - Metadata (e.g., tags, completion status, created/modified timestamps, author information)
- **Offline Support**: Enable users to work offline with automatic syncing when reconnected.
- **Cloud Sync**: Synchronize data across devices via a secure cloud backend.

---

#### **5. Advanced Features**
- **Custom Filters and Views**:
  - Filter nodes by tags, completion status, or due dates.
  - Allow users to save custom filters as reusable views.
- **Integrations**:
  - Support exporting/importing to Markdown, OPML, JSON, or plain text formats.
  - Integrate with third-party tools like Google Calendar, Trello, or Notion for enhanced workflows.
- **Recurring Tasks**: Allow users to set recurring items with customizable schedules.
- **Templates**: Provide pre-defined templates for common workflows (e.g., project management, meeting notes).
- **Search Operators**: Advanced search capabilities with operators for tags, dates, and metadata.

---

#### **6. Performance and Scalability**
- **Efficient Rendering**: Use virtual DOM or equivalent rendering optimization for handling large nested structures without performance issues.
- **Fast Search**: Implement indexing for quick search across potentially large datasets.
- **Cross-Platform**: Native apps for web, mobile (iOS, Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), all synchronized seamlessly.

---

#### **7. Security**
- **User Authentication**:
  - Support for OAuth, single sign-on (SSO), or email/password login.
  - Optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Encryption**:
  - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
  - Encrypted storage on the backend.
- **Access Control**:
  - Fine-grained permission settings for shared workspaces or items.

---

#### **8. Settings and Preferences**
- **Custom Appearance**:
  - Light and dark modes.
  - Adjustable font size and spacing.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Editor**: Allow users to customize shortcuts.
- **Export Options**: Export workspaces in different formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.).
- **Notifications**:
  - Optional reminders for time-sensitive items.
  - Notifications for shared workspace changes.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of users and large hierarchies seamlessly.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Screen reader support.
  - WCAG-compliant color contrasts.
- **Localization**: Support multiple languages with easy switching.
- **API**: Provide a public API for developers to integrate or extend functionalities.

---

### **Technology Stack Suggestions**
- **Frontend**: React, Svelte, or similar frameworks for a responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (FastAPI), or Go for scalable API services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for hierarchical data storage.
- **Real-Time Sync**: WebSockets or Firebase for real-time collaboration.
- **Mobile**: Flutter or React Native for cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Desktop**: Electron for desktop apps.
